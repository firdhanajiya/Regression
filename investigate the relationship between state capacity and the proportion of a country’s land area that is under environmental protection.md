In this part of the assignment, I investigated the relationship between state capacity and the proportion of a country’s land area that is under environmental protection. 
The data set hw3_data.csv contains a measure of state capacity (from Hansen and Sigman 2021) as well as the percentage of each country’s land area that is classified as protected (from the World Bank).
In Analytical Politics I, we have learned that societies may under provide public goods, so they instead rely on the state to use coercive taxation to provide these goods. However, the state must have sufficient capacity—
administrative, coercive, fiscal—in order for it to effectively intervene in the provisioning of a public good. 
Because environmental protection is an example of a public good, we might expect that stronger states tend to provision a higher level of environmental protection. 
In particular, high-capacity states might be able to more effectively design, implement, and enforce environmental regulations. However, environmental protection often involves political trade-offs: setting aside land for conservation can constrain economic activity and provoke resistance
from organized interests (e.g., extractive industries). 
In weaker states, governments may designate protected areas symbolically, without enforcing restrictions; conversely, even strong states may prioritize industrial or agricultural development over conservation. Thus, the relationship between state capacity and environmental protection is
ultimately an empirical question.
As part of recently adopted global biodiversity goals, countries have pledged to increase the share of land and marine areas under protection to 30 percent by 2030, which is roughly twice the level observed in 2017. 

In this analysis, I conducted the following analysis:
1. Construct a scatterplot showing the relationship between the proportion of protected land areas and state capacity score. The proportion of protected land areas is measured on the vertical axis (y-axis), and state capacity on the horizontal axis (x-axis). I have provided a brief description of the relationship between these two variables based on a visual inspection.
2. Run a regression of percent of protected land area (dependent variable) on the state capacity score (independent variable), and plot the regression line atop scatterplot.
3. Determine the estimated intercept and coefficient, interpret them.
4. Calculate the predicted percent of land under protection in a country with a state capacity of 3.
